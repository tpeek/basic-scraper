# Summary
This is a simple web scraper. It has a script that scrapes restaurant health inspection data from the King County government website. The data is processed and printed, allowing the user to see metadata and score information about each business returned in the initial search query. A JSON file is created that, when opened in http://geojson.io, will display markers on a map in the location of the businesses that were returned in the search query.
